Globally, over 1.2 billion children are out of the classroom. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Research suggests that online learning has been shown to increase retention of information, and take less time, meaning the changes coronavirus have caused might be here to stay.</p>

                            An online class is a course conducted over the Internet. They are generally conducted through a learning management system, in which students can view their course syllabus and academic progress, as well as communicate with fellow students and their course instructor.

                            Online classes are generally self-paced, allowing for greater flexibility in completing coursework. Some examples of online courses are MOOCs, or Massive Open Online Courses, as produced by organizations such as edX or Coursera. Many traditional universities offer online courses, including Purdue University via their takeover of Kaplan.</p>

                            <p class="text-muted mb-0">1. Efficiency - 
                                Online learning offers teachers an efficient way to deliver lessons to students. Online learning has a number of tools such as videos, PDFs, podcasts, and teachers can use all these tools as part of their lesson plans.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                2. Accessibility Of Time And Place - 
                                Another advantage of online education is that it allows students to attend classes from any location of their choice. It also allows schools to reach out to a more extensive network of students, instead of being restricted by geographical boundaries.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                3. Affordability - 
                                Another advantage of online learning is reduced financial costs. Online education is far more affordable as compared to physical learning.

                            <p class="text-muted mb-0">1. Inability To Focus On Screens - 
                                For many students, one of the biggest challenges of online learning is the struggle with focusing on the screen for long periods of time.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                                2. Technology Issues - 
                                Another key challenge of online classes is internet connectivity. While internet penetration has grown in leaps and bounds over the past few years, in smaller cities and towns, a consistent connection with decent speed is a problem. 
                            </p>
                            <br>

                                3. Sense Of Isolation - 
                                Students can learn a lot from being in the company of their peers. However, in an online class, there are minimal physical interactions between students and teachers. This often results in a sense of isolation for the students.

                            Headsets are necessary equipment in online classes. Teachers and students must have one. You can address your students' questions and concerns better if you can hear them well. Students can understand the lesson better when they can clearly hear what the teacher is saying.
